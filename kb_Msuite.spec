/*
A KBase module: kb_Msuite
This SDK module is developed to wrap the open source package CheckM which consists of a set of tools 
for assessing the quality of genomes recovered from isolates, single cells, or metagenomes. 
CheckM consists of a series of commands in order to support a number of different analyses and workflows.

        required params:
        putative_genomes_folder: folder path that holds all putative genome files with (fa as the file extension) to be checkM-ed
        checkM_workflow_name: name of the CheckM workflow,e.g., lineage_wf or taxonomy_wf
        file_extension: the extension of the putative genome file, should be "fna"

        contig_file: contig file path/shock_id in File structure
        out_header: output file header
        workspace_name: the name of the workspace it gets saved to.

        semi-required: at least one of the following parameters is needed
        abund_list: contig abundance file(s)/shock_id(s)
        reads_list: reads file(s)/shock_id(s) in fasta or fastq format

        optional params:
        thread: number of threads; default 1
        external_genes: indicating an external gene call instead of using prodigal, default 0
        external_genes_file: the file containing genes for gene call, default "" 

        reassembly: specify this option if you want to reassemble the bins.
                    note that at least one reads file needs to be designated.
        prob_threshold: minimum probability for EM algorithm; default 0.8
        markerset: choose between 107 marker genes by default or 40 marker genes
        min_contig_length: minimum contig length; default 1000
        plotmarker: specify this option if you want to plot the markers in each contig
