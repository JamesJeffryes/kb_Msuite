/*
A KBase module: kb_Msuite
This SDK module is developed to wrap the open source package CheckM which consists of a set of tools 
for assessing the quality of genomes recovered from isolates, single cells, or metagenomes. 
CheckM consists of a series of commands in order to support a number of different analyses and workflows.
