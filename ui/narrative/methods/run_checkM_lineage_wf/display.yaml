    <p>CheckM provides a set of tools for assessing the quality of genomes recovered from isolates, single cells, or metagenomes. It provides robust estimates of genome completeness and contamination by using collocated sets of genes that are ubiquitous and single-copy within a phylogenetic lineage. Assessment of genome quality can also be examined using plots depicting key genomic characteristics (e.g., GC, coding density) which highlight sequences outside the expected distributions of a typical genome.</p>
    <p><hr></p>
    <p><b>Configuration:</b></p>
    <p><b><i>Assembly or BinnedContigs:</i></b> A user may submit a single genome assembly object or a BinnedContig object containing multiple "binned" genomes.  In the latter case, a separate evaluation of the genome completeness using the clade-specific phylogenetic marker genes will be performed.</p>
    <p><b><i>Save full output:</i></b> The user has the option of generating and downloading all possible output from the CheckM "lineage" workflow.  Selecting this option will slow down the runtime.</p>
    <p><b><i>Save all plots:</i></b> The user has the option of generating and downloading all possible plots from the CheckM "lineage" workflow.  Selecting this option will slow down the runtime.</p>
    <p><hr></p>
    <p><b>Output:</b></p>
    <p><b><i>Output Object:</i></b> No output object is generated by CheckM lineage assessment.</p>
    <p><b><i>Output Report:</i></b> The output report offers both a graphical and a tabular representation of the phylogenetic marker completeness and contamination.  CheckM generates clade-specific marker gene sets for each bin, and reports the taxonomic resolution possible for each bin in the "Marker Lineage" column.  The number of genomes that were used in generating each marker set is given, as is the number of markers generated.  Marker genes are typically single-copy, so the occurance of more than one in a given genome or bin may indicate contamination, which is indicated with yellow to red bars in the graphical depiction and by the columns "2" to "5+" in the table.  The fraction of marker genes that occur as duplicates is used to calculate the "Contamination" percentage inthe table.  Missing clade-specific phylogenetic markers are shown in gray in the plot and by the column "0" in the table, with the "Completeness" value obtained by the proportion of the missing markers to the total number of markers used.  The presence of one and exactly one copy of a marker is indicated with a green bar in the plot and the tally in the "1" column of the table.  Ideally, a perfect Genome will have all markers in exactly one copy if the derivation of the markers was itself perfectly done and biology was perfectly predictable.</p>
    <p><b><i>Downloadable files:</i></b> Plots and data output by the CheckM lineage workflow may be downloaded.</p>
